# statisticsOnJapan

This is a project made by Colin Polder
This project scrapes things from the Japanese Government Site at <url>https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&layout=datalist&toukei=00200356&tstat=000001140586&cycle=0&year=20190&month=0&tclass1=000001140589</url> and refines the data to make predictions on the statistics on this website. 
I am a college student and this was made as a project for my college. Please do not expect fulltime maintenance of this project. 
Please feel free to send me remarks on this project if you have any suggestions for additions or anything similar.
